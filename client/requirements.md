## Packages
framer-motion | Essential for the smooth dropdown animations and page transitions
lucide-react | For the icons in categories and links

## Notes
The backend provides a single endpoint `/api/bio` that returns the profile and nested categories/links.
Images should be circular jpgs as requested.
The design needs to be "game-like" with sharp/curved borders and a cloud/sun background.
